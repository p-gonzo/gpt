There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come, equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner Now the doctor came in, stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able" Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it, no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival Try to see it my way,
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way,
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
We can work it out,
We can work it out Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying,
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night
We can work it out,
We can work it out Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime,
So I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way,
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long
We can work it out,
We can work it out Life is very short, and there's no time

Science in the home.
Late nights all alone with a test tube.
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine,
Calls her on the phone.
"Can I take you out to the pictures,
Joa, oa, oa, oan?" But as she's getting ready to go,
A knock comes on the door. Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead. Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again.
Teacher gets annoyed.
Wishing to avoid and unpleasant
Sce, e, e, ene, She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away,
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times "I must not be
So, o, o, o" But when she turns her back on the boy,
He creeps up from behind. Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead. P. C. Thirty-one said, "We caught a dirty one."
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures.
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them
So, o, o, o. But as the words are leaving his lips,
A noise comes from behind. Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead. Whoa, oh, oh, oh.
Silver hammer man Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away How can I even try?
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
"Love will find a way?"
Gather round all you clowns

Hey you've got to hide your love away Last night I said these words to my girl

			Down along the cove
I spied my true love comin’ my way
Down along the cove
I spied my true love comin’ my way
I say, “Lord, have mercy, mama
It sure is good to see you comin’ today"

Down along the cove
I spied my little bundle of joy
Down along the cove
I spied my little bundle of joy
She said, “Lord, have mercy, honey
I’m so glad you’re my boy!”

Down along the cove
We walked together hand in hand
Down along the cove
We walked together hand in hand.
Ev’rybody watchin’ us go by
Knows we’re in love, yes, and they understand										 
			I was blinded by the devil
Born already ruined
Stone-cold dead
As I stepped out of the womb
By His grace I have been touched
By His word I have been healed
By His hand I’ve been delivered
By His spirit I’ve been sealed

I’ve been saved
By the blood of the lamb
Saved
By the blood of the lamb
Saved
Saved
And I’m so glad
Yes, I’m so glad
I’m so glad
So glad
I want to thank You, Lord
I just want to thank You, Lord
Thank You, Lord

By His truth I can be upright
By His strength I do endure
By His power I’ve been lifted
In His love I am secure
He bought me with a price
Freed me from the pit
Full of emptiness and wrath
And the fire that burns in it

I’ve been saved
By the blood of the lamb
Saved
By the blood of the lamb
Saved
Saved
And I’m so glad
Yes, I’m so glad
I’m so glad
So glad
I want to thank You, Lord
I just want to thank You, Lord
Thank You, Lord

Nobody to rescue me
Nobody would dare
I was going down for the last time
But by His mercy I’ve been spared
Not by works
But by faith in Him who called
For so long I’ve been hindered
For so long I’ve been stalled

I’ve been saved
By the blood of the lamb
Saved
By the blood of the lamb
Saved
Saved
And I’m so glad
Yes, I’m so glad
I’m so glad
So glad
I want to thank You, Lord
I just want to thank You, Lord
Thank You, Lord										 
			Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion
Always on the outside of whatever side there was
When they asked him why it had to be that way, “Well,” he answered,
“just because”

Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last
They called Joe “Crazy,” the baby they called “Kid Blast”
Some say they lived off gambling and runnin’ numbers too
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue

Joey, Joey
King of the streets, child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away?

There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin’ he was bulletproof

The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners
They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs

The hostages were tremblin’ when they heard a man exclaim
“Let’s blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame”
But Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, “We’re not those kind of men
It’s peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again”

Joey, Joey
King of the streets, child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away?

The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith
They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with
“What time is it?” said the judge to Joey when they met
“Five to ten,” said Joey. The judge says, “That’s exactly what you get”

He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich
They threw him in the hole one time for tryin’ to stop a strike
His closest friends were black men ’cause they seemed to understand
What it’s like to be in society with a shackle on your hand

When they let him out in ’71 he’d lost a little weight
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great
He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind
To the boss he said, “I have returned and now I want what’s mine”

Joey, Joey
King of the streets, child of clay
Joey, Joey
Why did they have to come and blow you away?

It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun
“I’m around too many children,” he’d say, “they should never know of one”
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe
Emptied out the register, said, “Tell ’em it was Crazy Joe”

One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York
He could see it comin’ through the door as he lifted up his fork
He pushed the table over to protect his family
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy

Joey, Joey
King of the streets, child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away?

Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep
I heard his best friend Frankie say, “He ain’t dead, he’s just asleep”
Then I saw the old man’s limousine head back towards the grave
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save

The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born
And someday if God’s in heaven overlookin’ His preserve
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve

Joey, Joey
King of the streets, child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away?										 
			We carried you in our arms
On Independence Day
And now you’d throw us all aside
And put us on our way
Oh what dear daughter ’neath the sun
Would treat a father so
To wait upon him hand and foot
And always tell him, “No?”
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know
We’re so alone
And life is brief

We pointed out the way to go
And scratched your name in sand
Though you just thought it was nothing more
Than a place for you to stand
Now, I want you to know that while we watched
You discover there was no one true
Most ev’rybody really thought
It was a childish thing to do
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know
We’re so low
And life is brief

It was all very painless
When you went out to receive
All that false instruction
Which we never could believe
And now the heart is filled with gold
As if it was a purse
But, oh, what kind of love is this
Which goes from bad to worse?
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know
We’re so low
And life is brief										  
			Can’t you hear that rooster crowin’?
Rabbit runnin’ down across the road
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through
So happy just to see you smile
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you

Can’t you hear that motor turnin’?
Automobile comin’ into style
Comin’ down the road for a country mile or two
So happy just to see you smile
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you

The night passed away so quickly
It always does when you’re with me

Can’t you feel that sun a-shinin’?
Groundhog runnin’ by the country stream
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true
So happy just to be alive
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you

So happy just to be alive
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you
New morning . . .										 
			I’ve just reached a place
Where the willow don’t bend
There’s not much more to be said
It’s the top of the end
I’m going
I’m going
I’m gone

I’m closin’ the book
On the pages and the text
And I don’t really care
What happens next
I’m just going
I’m going
I’m gone

I been hangin’ on threads
I been playin’ it straight
Now, I’ve just got to cut loose
Before it gets late
So I’m going
I’m going
I’m gone

Grandma said, “Boy, go and follow your heart
And you’ll be fine at the end of the line
All that’s gold isn’t meant to shine
Don’t you and your one true love ever part”

I been walkin’ the road
I been livin’ on the edge
Now, I’ve just got to go
Before I get to the ledge
So I’m going
I’m just going
I’m gone										 
			Bye and bye, I’m breathin’ a lover’s sigh
I’m sittin’ on my watch so I can be on time
I’m singin’ love’s praises with sugar-coated rhyme
Bye and bye, on you I’m casting my eye

I’m paintin’ the town—swinging my partner around
I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust
I’m watchin’ the roads, I’m studying the dust
I’m paintin’ the town making my last go-round

Well, I’m scufflin’ and I’m shufflin’ and I’m walkin’ on briars
I’m not even acquainted with my own desires

I’m rollin’ slow—I’m doing all I know
I’m tellin’ myself I found true happiness
That I’ve still got a dream that hasn’t been repossessed
I’m rollin’ slow, goin’ where the wild roses grow

Well the future for me is already a thing of the past
You were my first love and you will be my last

Papa gone mad, mamma, she’s feeling sad
I’m gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more
I’m gonna establish my rule through civil war
Gonna make you see just how loyal and true a man can be										 
			I have heard rumors all over town
They say that you’re planning to put me down
All I would like you to do
Is tell me that it isn’t true

They say that you’ve been seen with some other man
That he’s tall, dark and handsome, and you’re holding his hand
Darlin’, I’m a-countin’ on you
Tell me that it isn’t true

To know that some other man is holdin’ you tight
It hurts me all over, it doesn’t seem right

All of those awful things that I have heard
I don’t want to believe them, all I want is your word
So darlin’, you better come through
Tell me that it isn’t true

All of those awful things that I have heard
I don’t want to believe them, all I want is your word
So darlin’, I’m countin’ on you
Tell me that it isn’t true										 
			When your mother sends back all your invitations
And your father to your sister he explains
That you’re tired of yourself and all of your creations
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?

Now when all of the flower ladies want back what they have lent you
And the smell of their roses does not remain
And all of your children start to resent you
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?

Now when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Have died in battle or in vain
And you’re sick of all this repetition
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?

When all of your advisers heave their plastic
At your feet to convince you of your pain
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?

Now when all the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
All lay down their bandanas and complain
And you want somebody you don’t have to speak to
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?										 
			I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love

Don’t need a shot of heroin to kill my disease
Don’t need a shot of turpentine, only bring me to my knees
Don’t need a shot of codeine to help me to repent
Don’t need a shot of whiskey, help me be president

I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love

Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it’s makin’ me feel afraid
What I got ain’t painful, it’s just bound to kill me dead
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head

I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love

I don’t need no alibi when I’m spending time with you
I’ve heard all of them rumors and you have heard ’em too
Don’t show me no picture show or give me no book to read
It don’t satisfy the hurt inside nor the habit that it feeds

I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love

Why would I want to take your life?
You’ve only murdered my father, raped his wife
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends

I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love

Don’t wanna be with nobody tonight
Veronica not around nowhere, Mavis just ain’t right
There’s a man that hates me and he’s swift, smooth and near
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he’s here?

I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love

What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Don’t even feel like crossing the street and my car ain’t actin’ right
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away
My conscience is beginning to bother me today

I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love

I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love
If you’re a doctor, I need a shot of love										 
			Every step of the way we walk the line
Your days are numbered, so are mine
Time is pilin’ up, we struggle and we scrape
We’re all boxed in, nowhere to escape

City’s just a jungle; more games to play
Trapped in the heart of it, tryin' to get away
I was raised in the country, I been workin’ in the town
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down

Got nothin' for you, I had nothin' before
Don’t even have anything for myself anymore
Sky full of fire, pain pourin’ down
Nothing you can sell me, I’ll see you around

All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

Well, the devil’s in the alley, mule’s in the stall
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all
I was thinkin’ 'bout the things that Rosie said
I was dreaming I was sleepin' in Rosie’s bed

Walkin' through the leaves, falling from the trees
Feelin' like a stranger nobody sees
So many things that we never will undo
I know you’re sorry, I’m sorry too

Some people will offer you their hand and some won’t
Last night I knew you, tonight I don’t
I need somethin’ strong to distract my mind
I’m gonna look at you ’til my eyes go blind

Well I got here followin' the southern star
I crossed that river just to be where you are
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

Well my ship’s been split to splinters and it’s sinkin' fast
I’m drownin’ in the poison, got no future, got no past
But my heart is not weary, it’s light and it’s free
I’ve got nothin’ but affection for all those who’ve sailed with me

Everybody movin’ if they ain’t already there
Everybody got to move somewhere
Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow
Things should start to get interestin' right about now

My clothes are wet, tight on my skin
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
I know that fortune is waitin’ to be kind
So give me your hand and say you’ll be mine

Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay
You can always come back, but you can’t come back all the way
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long										  
			You took a part of me that I really miss
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this
You told yourself a lie, that’s all right mama I told myself one too
I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

You took the silver, you took the gold
You left me standing out in the cold
People ask about you, I didn’t tell them everything I knew
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

I’m drifting in and out of dreamless sleep
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep
Did so many things I never did intend to do
Well, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low
I need every bit of it for the places that I go
Sometimes I wonder just what it’s all coming to
Well, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

Well, I don’t dare close my eyes and I don’t dare wink
Maybe in the next life I’ll be able to hear myself think
Feel like talking to somebody but I just don’t know who
Well, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

The last thing you said before you hit the street
“Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet”
I said, “That’s all right mama . . . you . . . you do what you gotta do”
Well, I’m tryin’ to get closer. I’m still a million miles from you

Rock me, pretty baby, rock me ’til everything gets real
Rock me for a little while, rock me ’til there’s nothing left to feel
And I’ll rock you too
I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

Well, there’s voices in the night trying to be heard
I’m sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word
I know plenty of people who would put me up for a day or two
Yes, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you										 
			Precious angel, under the sun
How was I to know you’d be the one
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?

Now there’s spiritual warfare and flesh and blood breaking down
Ya either got faith or ya got unbelief and there ain’t no neutral ground
The enemy is subtle, how be it we are so deceived
When the truth’s in our hearts and we still don’t believe?

Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Ya know I just couldn’t make it by myself
I’m a little too blind to see

My so-called friends have fallen under a spell
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, “All is well”
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
When men will beg God to kill them and they won’t be able to die?

Sister, lemme tell you about a vision I saw
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him about Mohammed
in the same breath
You never mentioned one time the Man who came and died a criminal’s death

Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Ya know I just couldn’t make it by myself
I’m a little too blind to see

Precious angel, you believe me when I say
What God has given to us no man can take away
We are covered in blood, girl, you know our forefathers were slaves
Let us hope they’ve found mercy in their bone-filled graves

You’re the queen of my flesh, girl, you’re my woman, you’re my delight
You’re the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night
But there’s violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
On the way out of Egypt, through Ethiopia, to the judgment hall of Christ

Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Ya know I just couldn’t make it by myself
I’m a little too blind to see										 a man
But if you'll bring that steamdrill 'round I'll beat it fair and honest.
I'll die with that hammer in my hand but, I'll be laughin',
Cause you can't replace a steel-drivin' man. There was a big crowd of people at the mountain.
John Henry said to the steam-drill "How is you?
Said pardon me, Mister Steamdrill I suppose you didn't hear me.
I said how are you Huh?
Can you turn a jack? Can you lay a track? Can you pick and shovel too?
Listen, this hammer-swinger's talkin' to you. Two-thousand people hollered, "Go John Henry!"
Then somebody hollered," The mountain's cavin' in!"
John Henry told the captin, "Tell the kind-folks not to worry
It ain't nothin' but my hammer suckin' wind, it keeps me breathin'
This steel-driver's muscle it ain't thin. "Captain tell the people to move back farther
I'm at the finish line and ain't no drill
It's so far behind that it don't got the brains to quit it
When she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills Lord, Lord
When she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills" Now, John Henry had a little woman
I believe the lady's name was Paulie Ann yeah that was his good woman
John Henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home
Early next mornin' he said,
"Come here Paulie Ann, come here sugar.
Said you know I been laying here, watching that sun come up
And I believe this is the first time I've seen the sun come up
That I couldn't come up with it
He said, (dirty mind),
He said take that hammer, Paulie Ann and go to that railroad
And when you swinging with that lead man
You tell em that's not all I can do. Tell em,
I can hoist a jack and I can lay a track I can pick and shovel too.
Ain't no machine can that's been proved to you! There was a big crowd of mourners at the church house
The section hands laid him in the sand
Trains go by on the rails John Henry laid.
They slow down and take off the hats,
When they come to whoreys lynn retsina' his back.
They say,"Mornin' Steel-driver, you sure was a hammer-swinger."
Then they go on by pickin' up a little bit of speed.
Clickity clack Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man lord lord
Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man lord lord
Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man Yonder lies a steel-drivin' Thank you very much
You know John Honey was a real man. He worked on a tunnel in West Virginia
Digin' a tunnel for the San Jose railroad.
And he was a mighty big man they say
That from his heels, on around to the ground he had a stroke of 19 feet
Boy that's a long stroke. Wooo that's a long stroke Ira Hayes...
Ira Hayes...
Call him drunken Ira Hayes,
He won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey drinking Indian,
Or the marine that went to war. Gather 'round me people,
There's a story I would tell,
'Bout a brave young Indian,
You should remember well.
From the land of the Pima Indian,
A proud and noble band,
Who farmed the Phoenix Valley,
In Arizona land.
Down the ditches a thousand years,
The waters grew Ira's peoples' crops,
'Til the white man stole their water rights,
And the sparkling water stopped.
Now, Ira's folks were hungry,
And their land grew crops of weeds,
When war came, Ira volunteered,
And forgot the white man's greed. Call him drunken Ira Hayes,
He won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey drinking Indian,
Or the marine that went to war. There they battled up Iwo Jima hill,
Two hundred and fifty men,
But only twenty-seven lived,
To walk back down again.
And when the fight was over,
And Old Glory raised,
Among the men who held it high,
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes. Call him drunken Ira Hayes,
He won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey drinking Indian,
Or the marine that went to war. Ira Hayes returned a hero,
Celebrated through the land,
He was wined and speeched and honored,
Everybody shook his hand,
But he was just a Pima Indian,
No water, no home, no chance,
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done,
And when did the Indians dance. Call him drunken Ira Hayes,
He won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey drinking Indian,
Or the marine that went to war. Then Ira started drinking hard,
Jail was often his home,
They let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone.
He died drunk early one morning,
Alone in the land he fought to save,
Two inches of water and a lonely ditch,
Was a grave for Ira Hayes. Call him drunken Ira Hayes,
He won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey drinking Indian,
Or the marine that went to war. Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes,
But his land is just as dry,
And his ghost is lying thirsty,
In the ditch where Ira died. Life is like a mountain railway
With an engineer that's brave
We must make the run successful
From the cradle to the grave Heed the curves and watch the tunnels
Never falter, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail Blessed Savior, Thou will guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In that train forevermore Oh, Blessed Savior, Thou will guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In God's grace forevermore To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say,
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
"He's an outlaw loose and runnin'", came a whisper from each lip
"And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip" In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more,
One and nineteen more Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He was here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter that he was after Texas Red,
After Texas Red Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry, men who tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip,
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip Now the morning passed so quickly and it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they rode out in the street
Folks were watchin' from their windows,
Every body held their breath,
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death,
About to meet his death There was twenty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip It was over in a moment and the crowd all gathered 'round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin' but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip Big iron, big iron,
Oh he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip How high's the water, mama?
Two feet high and risin'

Five feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa?
She said it's five feet high and risin' Well the rails are washed out north of town
We gotta head for higher ground
We can't come back till the water goes down,
Five feet high and risin' Well, it's five feet high and risin' (When he reached down his hand for me)
Once my soul was astray from the heavenly way I was wretched and vile as could be
But my Saviour in love gave me peace from above
When he reached down his hand for me
When he reached down his hand for me when he reached way down for me
I was lost and undone without my God or his son
When he reached down his hand for me
[ guitar ]
I was near to despair when he came to me there
And he showed me that I could be free
Then he lifted my feet gave me gladness complete
When he reached down his hand for me
When he reached down...  love you, baby, so much Dready got a job to do

Through it all Remembering the days when our love began
Thinkin' of a million ways
To escape and be with you
But reality wasn't just you and I
It was long drawn out days and lonely nights Dreamin' bout you
I keep dreamin' bout you
When I'm dreamin' bout when you would say [Chorus]
Let me take you to another place
Where nothing ever seems to matter
Its just you and me
We can take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen moments with you (oh oh) Destiny didn't have such a simple plan (simple plan)
I was just a girl and you a young man
How could age define
Something so divine (so divine)
Can this even be real or just exist in my mind Dreamin' bout you
I keep dreamin' 'bout you
When I'm dreamin' 'bout when you would say [Chorus] Dreamin' bout you
I keep dreamin' bout you
When I'm dreamin and waiting for the day
When no one and nothing else takes up our time
Finally you're only mine Each and everyday
I don't walk with you right by my side
But instead we have to hide
Sneak around and lie
Just to spend time alone
This lovin is a crime
I'd rather do the time
And leave the world behind [Chorus] Let's get away
Let's get away
Oh oh We can get away
We can get away
Oh oh Let's get away
Let's get away
Oh oh We can get away
We can get away
Oh oh Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive
That would be enough And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind
If you could let me inside your heart Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay And I would be enough
And this could be enough
This would be enough Said, I would be enough
And this could be enough
See, we could be enough
Oh baby I could be enough
We could be enough
This could be enough
Ooh Don't look no further
Don't go nowhere
I could be enough (I could be enough)
We could have it all Tell me baby (baby)
Can you feel me? (ay)
Can I be enough? (Can I be enough?)
And your family? (Me and your family?)
Listen, baby (Listen, baby)
We can have it all (We could have it all)
Can I be enough? (Can I be enough?)
Yeah

To be alive right now
Look around, look around Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around

When seeing your ID on mine
Made me crazy
Ooh baby I'm saying Let's go back there

Back in time
When you wanted to know my every move
Tired to keep it smooth
Keepin' up with me
You drove me crazy oh baby Let's go back there
Let's take it there When you
Didn't know me
Didn't need me
I wanted to touch me
Couldn't leave me

Far it would go
I couldn't know if

We just could not
We just could not get enough of it baby , let's go Have that wreckless love
That crazy love
That off the wall won't stop til I get enough kind of love
I need that love
So baby, let's go Have that wreckless love
That crazy love

We can have it anywhere
Kind of love
That wreckless love Let's go back in time
When our kiss was brand new
An adventure not perfected
A little hesitant Let's go back there
Let's take it there Take it back in time
When forever was a minute, and eternity was a second
I'm stressing that we have to go back there
Let's take it there. When you
Didn't know me
Didn't need me
I wanted to touch me
Couldn't leave me
I couldn't know how
Far it would go
I couldn't know if
This was for sure
We just could not
We just could not get enough of it baby , let's go Have that wreckless love
That crazy love
That off the wall won't stop til I get enough kind of love
I need that love
So baby, let's go Have that wreckless love
That crazy love
That I don't really care
We can have it anywhere
Kind of love
That wreckless love Ooh baby, let's go Have that wreckless love
That crazy love
That off the wall won't stop til I get enough kind of love
I need that love
So baby, let's go Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every night I cry
Every night I sigh
Every night I wonder why
You treat me cold
Yeah, you won't let me go Every little hurt counts
Every little hurt counts
You say you're coming home
Yet you'd never phone
Leave me all alone
My love is strong for you
I'd do wrong for you I can't take this loneliness you've given me
I can't go on giving my life away
Come back to me
Darling you'll see
I can give you all the things that you wanted before
If you will stay with me Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
To you, I'm a toy
And you're the boy
Who has to say
What I should play
Yeah, you hurt me
Desert me Come back to me
Darling, you'll see
I can give you all the things that you wanted before
If you will stay with me Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts e crazy
And a dream of a baby
Like a promise to be free
Children laughing out to sea
All his sea dreams come to me Through the windless wells of wonder
By the throbbing light machine
In a tea leaf trance or under
Orders from the king and queen Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one People hurry by so quickly
Don't they hear the melodies
In the chiming and the clicking
And the laughing harmonies Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one Some come dark and strange like dying
Crows and ravens whistling
Lines of weeping, strings of crying
So much said in listening Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one Does the moon play only silver
When it strums the galaxy
Dying roses will they will their
Perfumed rhapsodies to me Songs to aging children come
This is one She pulls the shade, it's just another
Sunny Sunday
She dodges the light like Blanche DuBois
Bright colors fade away on such a sunny Sunday
She waits for the night to fall
Then she points a pistol through the door
And she aims at the streetlight
While the freeway hisses
Dogs bark as the gun falls to the floor
The streetlight's still burning
She always misses
But the day she hits
That's the day she'll leave
That one little victory, that's all she needs
She pulls the shade it's just another
Sunny Monday
She waits for the night to fall Out on some borderline
Some mark of in between
I lay down golden-in time
And woke up vanishing Sweet bird you are
Briefer than a falling star
All these vain promises on beauty jars
Somewhere with your wings on time
You must be laughing
Behind our eyes
Calendars of our lives
Circled with compromise
Sweet bird of time and change
You must be laughing
Up on your feathers laughing Golden in time
Cities under the sand
Power, ideals and beauty
Fading in everyone's hand Give me some time
I feel like I'm losing mine
Out here on this horizon line
With the earth spinning
And the sky forever rushing
No one knows
They can never get that close
Guesses at most
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching Fly silly seabird
No dreams can possess you
No voices can blame you
For sun on your wings
My gentle relations
Have names they must call me
For loving the freedom
Of all flying things
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry I came to the city
And lived like old Crusoe
On an island of noise
In a cobblestone sea
And the beaches were concrete
And the stars paid a light bill
And the blossoms hung false
On their store window trees
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry Out of the city
And down to the seaside
To sun on my shoulders
And wind in my hair
But sandcastles crumble
And hunger is human
And humans are hungry
For worlds they can't share
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry I call to a seagull
Who dives to the waters
And catches his silver-fine
Dinner alone
Crying where are the footprints
That danced on these beaches
And the hands that cast wishes
That sunk like a stone
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach Out of cry Every picture has its shadows
And it has some source of light
Blindness, blindness and sight
The perils of benefactors
The blessings of parasites
Blindness, blindness and sight
Threatened by all things
Devil of cruelty
Drawn to all things
Devil of delight
Mythical devil of the ever-present laws
Governing blindness, blindness and sight Suntans in reservation dining rooms
Pale miners in their lantern rays
Night, night and day
Hostage smile on presidents
Freedom scribbled in the subway
It's like night, night and day
Threatened by all things
God of cruelty
Drawn to all things
God of delight
Mythical god of the everlasting laws
Governing day, day and night Critics of all expression
Judges in black and white
Saying it's wrong, saying it's right
Compelled by prescribed standards
Or some ideals we fight
For wrong, wrong and right
Threatened by all things
Man of cruelty-mark of Cain
Drawn to all things
Man of delight-born again, born again
Man of the laws, the ever-broken laws
Governing wrong, wrong and right
Governing wrong, wrong and right
Wrong and right Twinkle, twinkle what a pity
All alone on such a pretty night
With enchantment on your side Popcorn, popcorn, cotton candy
Soft voice whispers, "This can all be right
If you'll come and share a ride" Carnival in Kenora
I let him take me for a ride
On a giant ferris wheel Up in the neon sky
Or far from the barker's cry
One kiss can sometimes
Make you feel like a spinning Ferris wheel All the tents are taken down now
All that's left is scuffled ground now
Still the magic echoes in the sand Popcorn, popcorn, cotton candy
Now a stranger takes my hand
We smile and the magic understands Carnival in Kenora
I let him take me for a ride
On a giant Ferris wheel Up in the neon sky
Or far from the barker's cry
One kiss can sometimes
Make you feel like a spinning Ferris wheel Out of the fire like Catholic saints
Comes Scarlett and her deep complaint
Mimicking tenderness she sees
In sentimental movies
A celluloid rider comes to town
Cinematic lovers sway
Plantations and sweeping ballroom gowns
Take her breath away Out in the wind in crinolines
Chasing the ghosts of Gable and Flynn
Through stand-in boys and extra players
Magnolias hopeful in her auburn hair
She comes from a school of southern charm
She likes to have things her way
Any man in the world holding out his arm
Would soon be made to pay Friends have told her not so proud
Neighbors trying to sleep and yelling "Not so loud!"
Lovers in anger Block of Ice
Harder and harder just to be nice
Given in the night to dark dreams
From the dark things she feels
She covers her eyes in the x-rated scenes
Running from the reels Beauty and madness to be praised
Cause it is not easy to be brave
To walk around in so much need
To carry the weight of all that greed
Dressed in stolen clothes she stands
Cast iron and frail
With her impossibly gentle hands
And her blood-red fingernails Out of the fire and still smoldering
She says "A woman must have everything"
Shades of Scarlett Conquering
She says "A woman must have everything" Tomorrow is Sunday
Now there's only one day left to go
Till you walk by
Below my window
The weekends drive me mad
Holidays are oh too sad
'Cause you don't go
Below my window No one knows I'm here
One day I just disappeared
And I took these two grey rooms up here
With a view
When you walk by
Below my window You look so youthful
Time has been untruthful
Heaven knows I loved you
30 years ago
Hot days your shirt's undone
Rainy days you run
Oh and then you fade so fast
Below my window No one knows I'm here
One day I just disappeared
And I took these two grey rooms up here
With a view
Only when you walk by
Below my window
When you walk by Below my window
Below my window
Hey hey
Below my window
Below my window
Below my window Three waitresses all wearing
Black diamond earrings
Talking about zombies
And Singapore slings
No trouble in their faces
Not one anxious voice
None of the crazy you get
From too much choice
The thumb and the satchel
Or the rented Rolls-Royce
And you think she knows something
By the second refill
You think she's enlightened
And she totals your bill
You say "Show me the way
To Barangrill" Well some say it's in service
They say "Humble Makes Pure"
You're hoping it's near Folly
'Cause you're headed that way for sure
And you just have to laugh
'Cause it's all so crazy
Ah, her mind's on her boyfriend
And eggs over easy
It's just a trick on you
Her mirrors and your will
So you ask the truck driver
On the way to the till
But he's just a slave
To Barangrill The guy at the gas pumps
He's got a lot of soul
He sings Merry Christmas for you
Just like Nat King Cole
And he makes up his own tune
Right on the spot
About whitewalls and windshields
And this job he's got
And you want to get moving
And you want to stay still
But lost in the moment
Some longing gets filled
And you even forget to ask
"Hey, where's Barangrill?" Rousseau walks on trumpet paths
Safaris to the heart of all that jazz
Through I bars and girders-through wires and pipes
The mathematic circuits of the modern nights
Through huts, through Harlem, through jails and gospel pews
Through the class on Park and the trash on Vine
Through Europe and the deep deep heart of Dixie blue
Through savage progress cuts the jungle line In a low-cut blouse she brings the beer
Rousseau paints a jungle flower behind her ear
Those cannibals-of shuck and jive
They'll eat a working girl like her alive
With his hard-edged eye and his steady hand
He paints the cellar full of ferns and orchid vines
And he hangs a moon above a five-piece band
He hangs it up above the jungle line The jungle line, the jungle line
Screaming in a ritual of sound and time
Floating, drifting on the air-conditioned wind
And drooling for a taste of something smuggled in
Pretty women funneled through valves and smoke
Coy and bitchy, wild and fine
And charging elephants and chanting slaving boats
Charging, chanting down the jungle line There's a poppy wreath on a soldier's tomb
There's a poppy snake in a dressing room
Poppy poison-poppy tourniquet
It slithers away on brass like mouthpiece spit
And metal skin and ivory birds
Go steaming up to Rousseau's vines
They go steaming up to Brooklyn Bridge
Steaming, steaming, steaming up the jungle line It was a rainy night
We took a taxi to your mother's home
She went to Florida and left you
With your father's gun, alone
Upon her small white bed
I fell into a dream
You sat up all the night and watched me
To see, who in the world I might be I am from the Sunday school
I sing soprano in the upstairs choir
You are a holy man
On the F.M. radio
I sat up all the night and watched thee
To see, who in the world you might be You called me beautiful
You called your mother-she was very tanned
So you packed your tent and you went
To live out in the Arizona sand
You are a refugee
From a wealthy family
You gave up all the golden factories
To see, who in the world you might be s mind, he won't be coming back
She'll hang the baskets on the walls
But I've seen it all before, heard the slamming of the door
Come summer, come fall
Come winter, there'll be baskets on the floor But I've seen it all before, heard the slamming of the door
Come summer, come fall
Come winter, there'll be baskets on the floor She'll hang the baskets on the wall
She'll hang the baskets on the wall
She'll hang the baskets on the wall
She'll hang the baskets on the wall
She'll hang the baskets on the wall
She'll hang the baskets on the wall Birds fall from the window ledge above mine.
Then they flap their wings at the last second.
You see birds fall from the window ledge above mine.
Then they flap their wings at the last second.
I can see their dead weight
Just dropping like stones
For small loaves of bread
Past my window all the time.
But unless I get up
Walk across the room
And peer down below
I don't see their last second curves
Toward a horizontal flight.
All these birds just falling from the ledge like stones.
Now due to a construct in my mind
That makes their falling and their flight
Symbolic of my entire existence,
It becomes important for me
To get up and see
Their last second curves toward flight.
It's almost as if my life will fall
Unless I see their ascent.

You tear down the bridge
Flimsy as it is,
It's business like.
You shake my hand
You break up the band
Flimsy as it is,
It's open mike
punk rock
Red white and blue,
You twist the knife
Then go home to kiss your wife
A bigger better slice
is what you'd like
You kick the sand
You get the upper hand
You sell it to Japan
It's natural
Punk rock
Red white and blue You turn the screws
It's what you choose to do
You think that I
Must turn them too
You think that I
Must be so satisfied
I stay inside
I wonder why And the cement mixer gets it all ready
One good turn at a time
Then pouring it slowly and steady
You're showing me where I can sign
What I can expect to find
But how you can you say you'll be happy
When you turn the screws You turn the screws
It's what you choose to do
You think that I
Must turn them too
You think that I
Must be so satisfied
I stay inside
I wonder why Excuse Me, I Think I've Got A Heartache
From Wheels-EP (iTunes exclusive) They just don't know how lost I feel without you
My teardrops never see the light of day
I laugh and joke and paint a bright tomorrow
But if I told the truth I'd have to say... Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
There's an aching deep inside
And it just won't be denied Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
And I'd better say goodbye
Before I cry I guess it's pride that makes me hide my sorrow
I live a lie in all I do and say
My lips may lie and paint a bright tomorrow
But if I told the truth I'd have to say... Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
There's an aching deep inside
And it just won't be denied Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
And I'd better say goodbye
Before I cry I'm writing a song all about you
A true song as real as my tears
But you've no need to fear it
'Cause no one will hear it
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
I'll tell all about how you cheated
I'd like for the whole world to hear
I'd like to get even
With you 'cause you're leavin'
But sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
It's a good thing that I'm not a star
You don't know how lucky you are
Though my record may say it
No one will play it
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
It's a good thing that I'm not a star
You don't know how lucky you are
Though my record may say it
No one will play it
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year Strangers in the night,
Exchanging glances
Wandering the night,
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away And ever since that night
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right I'm sitting by the window of your 32nd floor apartment
Waiting for your phone calls all to end
I'm sitting, watching wind blow, watching time go, watching cars go by
I'm waiting for these memories to begin If I threw my guitar
Out the window so far down
Would I start to regret it?
Or would I smile and watch it slowly fall, fall, fall? Garbage trucks and taxi cabs don't seem like they can reach me here
The clamor of jackhammers seems so faint
Well the way you treat me like the only slightly brings me down a lot
I don't think that I'll ever be the same If I threw my guitar
Out the window so far down
Would I start to regret it?
Or would I smile and watch it slowly fall, fall, fall? Keep on, keep on doing it
Right on, right on doing it
Baby, keep on Right on
Keep on doing it
Now my baby keep on
Keep on, keep on Wherever, wherever girl, I'll do it
Forever and ever, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll see you through it I've got to keep you pleased
In every way I can
Gonna give you all of me
As much as you can stand Make love to you right now
That's all I want to do
I know you need it, girl
And you know I need it, too 'Cause I found
What the world is searching for
Here, right here, my dear
I don't have to look no more And, oh, my babe
I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you
To make me feel the way you do I'm never, never gonna give ya up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
Not the way I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you I'm never ever gonna quit
'Cause quittin' just ain't my shtick
I'm gonna stay right here with you
Do all the things you want me to Whatever you want
Girl, you got it
And whatever you need
I don't want to see you without it You've given me much more
Than words could ever say
And oh, my dear, I'll be right here
Until my dying day I don't know just how to say
All the things I feel
I just know that I love you so
And it gives me such a thrill 'Cause I found
What this world is searching for
Here, right here, my dear
I don't have to look no more And all of my days
I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you
To make me feel the way you do I'm never, never gonna give ya up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
Stop the way I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you I'm never ever gonna quit
'Cause quittin' just ain't my shtick

'Cause quittin' just ain't my shtick  to my head
Talkin' about
Talkin' about
Talkin' about my baby
I don't know about it They don't know what I know
They don't know like I know
All the time I've been hangin' around
All the time I hang around
She didn't know

And she go walkin' down the street singin'
Everybody die
Da da dada da doo doo
Etc. (scat singing) They don't know
Nobody knows

Da da da... Way down Louisiana close to New Orleans,
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
Livin' in a cottage made of earth and wood,
Lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned to read or write so well,
But he could play the guitar just like ringing a bell. Go, go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Johnny B. Goode He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.
Oh, strummin' his guitar in the gentle shade,
Playing to the music that the drivers made.
People passing by they'd stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play Go, go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Johnny B. Goode His mama told him ?someday you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big old band.
All kinds a people coming from miles around
To hear ya play ya guitar 'till the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight. Go, go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Johnny B. Goode I am your trash man-
Throw out all your trash today-
Clean out your mind today-
Please pass the weed
And please take some heed.
Take your fast glass guns and
Throw them away.
There he goes, hey
I just the gypsy bandit. Gypsy talk-
She has been here 3 times and
The 4th time, she was emptied in from
The mouth of a bottle.
Seems like I seen you somewhere before-
And her dog named pig had a red
Neck shaped just like a cracker
Dipped in rot hole. Address 3rd trash can from the
Left. that's where I'll be-
Just take all your blues
And throw them at my feet.
-oh that's what friends are for.
Yes I sing the blues for me and you.
Let me do changes and come back
And tell you. so it won't be so hard
When it's time for you to go through. Anything is possible after an
Embarrassing situation- And once you take but all that
Rubbish and hate and-
Load it on my truck.
But don't make me work late-
I am your trashman-
And don't forget I also want
To live- not just survive-
I ain't your black slave- just
Because I just might try to
Wash out your mind- it's up to
Your friend-
To get up off your rusty behind. And please pass me the peace weed,
And take some heed-
Throw all that mixed up speed
Away- all that dirt is gonna clog and
Hurt- man you reach 100 years old in a day-
I am your trashman-
I am your trashman-
I come to keep your houses clean.
I am the trashman-
Take out all your dirty blues and
Dreams-
Well when I come around to
Collect for the bill,

My pleasure kill... I am the trashman
You must have seen me in
Your t.v.
I'm here to clean up-
All your hang ups or
Come downs, I'm gonna kill...
That's my duty.
So please don't try to make
Me crawl up no hill. May I whisper in your ear...
Say something you ought to hear...
Lots of people so dear
They're getting hurt... "lady's and gentlemen, the Jimi Hendrix experience." "I see that we meet again hmmm. yeah well, well, well. dig,
Dig, I'd like to get something strait, we umm we got tired
Of the experience, and every once in a while we're blowing
Our minds too much, so we decided to change everything around.
And a call it 'gypsy sons and rainbows' for short nothin' but
A band of gypsies. we have billy cox playin' bass, and um from
Nashville Tennessee we have lary lee playin' guitar over there,
We got juma playin' congos over there, juma, and we have granny
Goose, oh I'm sorry Mitch Mitchell on drums over there, and we
Got jerry velez on congos too. you got yours truly on Pete Whistle,
What me worry? gives us about a minute and a half to tune up ok.
Like we only had about two rehearsals so a we'll only do a primary
Rhythm thing. (someone in the background) I have mine thank you
I have mine thank you, baby." Black is gold is pure
And true kings of this earth. 1. So I say it's up to us to straighten
Out this mess...
We got to go through hell...
And then that's the last of this
Miserable test... 2. Black must be bold
Because it's gold and true
Kings of this world...
So let them go to the moon.
Yes let them go to mars.
Because deep down inside
They're really from the stars. 3. That's why they don't want
Us to mix...just the way
The word of God had said.
So let them go to saturn...that's
Where they'll learn instead.
Because black and white
Together is right...
And white by itself is
An egotistic elf. 4. So they show you how to
Kill...and if you don't
They will.
What do they know about
Happiness...
How can they about life...
They just got lost in space.
So when they landed,
Atlantis cried. So if they're so alone try
To make them feel at home.
So let them fetch you fire wood.
And let them nibble on the bone.
So invent a word called love.
And then they blame our mistakes on god.
Don't you know how lonely they must be.
So many light years from home.
Hey soulful people I'm calling.
Don't be no more slaves.
Because God will protect us
When it comes to doomsday.
Realize before it's too late...
That no one on earth will escape.
We are the kings of earth.
And axis gonna put them slaves...
They killed so many worlds before.
But they will pass sentence upon themselves...
When the earth opens up...will
They be saved from our hell. I feel the truth of life.
We better all realize...
People like me and you
We feel so bad, don't know
What to do... they keep us
High low on drugs.
And they got us making their rugs...
As we go dripping blood.
But the sun knows as
The wind blows and the
Fire grows towards the
Far shores and the water
Foams to make steamed
Bones of all of those who don't belive that...
Black is gold is the kings of this world.
We all better get our places
Before God tells us to our
Face we are...past the human race.
Let's pray that we all agree
We got to straighten out the family tree.
Life is for you and me togather.
That's the way it was meant to be.
White man watch your mouth
Because our drums, they face the south.
And you can't kill the god
That kept you alive between
The poles of the north and south.
You better adjust your place
In this world...before your
Hair, it starts to curl...and the
Yellow, red, and black of this
World will tear your ass and soul apart. Where is he coming from ?
From heaven where 1,000,000
Worlds are one.
Where is he going to ?
He's going to make contact
With the living and the dead...
Here comes black gold...
Gather round young and old...
He's going to be felt by the
Timid and the bold...
Within a wink of an eye, With the wink of an eye
Egos swell, bust and die...
Kingdoms fall and cry...
With the wink of an eye...
With the wink of an eye
A new born baby cries...
And a 100 soldiers die with
The wink of an eye.      let me sing Sha la la la-- la la la
Oh baby
Sha la la la-- la la la
Oh baby... The Lord is my Shepherd I shall not want
He makes me lie down in green pastures.
He leads me beside the still waters.
He restore'th my soul
And guides my path in righteousness
For His name's sake. Surely goodness and loving kindness
Shall follow me Al the days of my life.
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord
Forever and ever and ever. Though I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of death
I will not fear, Thou art with me.
Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table
Before me in the presence of my enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil
My cup's overflowing Surely goodness and loving kindness
Shall follow me Al the days of my life.
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord
Forever and ever and ever On this magic road I'm about to lose control
Oh, won't you bless my soul on this magic road
Down this magic road you can have anything you want
And leave out things you don't on this magic road What is this I see? What a mystery
What a time to meet, baby On this magic road smile is the down side

I will
Lay me down
In a bunker
Underground
I won't let this happen
To my children
Meet the real-world coming
Out of your shell
With white elephants
Sitting ducks
I will
Rise up
Little baby's eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes
Little baby's eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes
In the next world war
In a jack knifed juggernaut
I am born again
In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In a deep, deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
Fitter, happier
More productive
Comfortable
Not drinking too much
Regular exercise at the gym, three days a week
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
At ease
Eating well, no more microwave dinners and saturated fats
A patient, better driver
A safer car, baby smiling in back seat
Sleeping well, no bad dreams
No paranoia
Careful to all animals, never washing spiders down the plughole
Keep in contact with old friends, enjoy a drink now and then
Will frequently check credit at moral bank, hole in wall
Favours for favours, fond but not in love
Charity standing orders on sundays, ring-road supermarket
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
Car wash, also on sundays
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows, nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
Nothing so childish
At a better pace, slower and more calculated
No chance of escape
Now self-employed
Concerned, but powerless
An empowered and informed member of societ, pragmatism not idealism
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic
Like a cat
Tied to a stick
That's driven into
Frozen winter shit, the ability to laugh at weakness
Calm, fitter, healthier and more productive
A pig in a cage on antibiotics
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I wanna a perfect body
I wanna a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.
She's running out again,
She's running out
She's run run run run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
You don't wanna talk to me,
You don't wanna say the words,
You try to get off the hook,
You try to get off the hook.
Sprawling on a pin,
Hanging off the hook,
Trying to get yourself away,
Trying to get yourself away.
There's no use dwelling on,
On what might have been,
Just think of all the fun,
You could be having.
We know the way you talk,
We know what you want,
We know what you want,
What you really wanted.
Take a look around,
There's candles on the cake,
On what might have been,
The road you should have took,
Mistakes mistaken
There's no use dwelling on,
No use dwelling on.
It's such a beautiful day,
It's such a beautiful day,
Find yourself a ????,
Go and get some rest.
It's such a beautiful day.
It's such a beautiful day.
Go up to the mic,
Go up to the mic,
Go and get some rest.
The breath of the morning
I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town
Where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet
For cracks in the pavement
Up above
Aliens hover
Making home movies
For the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures
Who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves
And live for their secrets
They're all
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Oh
I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it
I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
They'd shut me away
But I'd be alright
Alright
I'm alright
Alright
I'm just
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Everyone
Everyone around here
Everyone is so near
It's holding on
It's holding on
Everyone
Everyone is so near
Everyone has got the fear
It's holding on
It's holding on
It's holding on
It's holding on
It's holding on
Wish that I could come out of the fog
Superhero powers
Burst out of the sand
in a bunch of flowers
you just say the word, apparition comes
with a long and winning handsome smile
wish we could connect
Step into the fog
of the diving board
blend into the light
down the cable lines
roll onto the earth
reforming on the wind
two places at once
taste the air with you
undo all the ties
wish that I could flip one of those lies
lift us on the wind
see that stretchy smile
go
Right across your
Face
Cut a hole (2x)
a hole (2x).
